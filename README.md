## My process

### Tools used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- SCSS variables
- SCSS mixins
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) - For CSS prefixes
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org) - For code linting
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Project building ttool

### What I learned

This project was a good exercise to practice some React concepts and APIs like **Context and Refs**, as well as to remember some Sass aspects such as **partials**, **maps**, etc.
I also learned how to configure ESlint in a simple way to help me find code errors more easily.

### Continued development

I find my React code a little hardcoded, one of the aspects I want to keep developing is my problem-solving techniques techniques. I also think my SCSS code can be improved by writing less code and reusing more classes, that's why I like to watch other people with more experience solving problems with different approaches than mine.
